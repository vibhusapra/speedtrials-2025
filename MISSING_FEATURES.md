# Missing Features - Quick Implementation Guide

## ðŸš¨ High-Impact Features We Should Add (Using Existing Data)

### 1. Last Inspection Date (site_visits table - 17,438 records)
```python
# Add to system details
last_inspection = db.query_df("""
    SELECT MAX(VISIT_DATE) as last_visit, 
           VISIT_REASON_CODE
    FROM site_visits 
    WHERE PWSID = ?
""", (pwsid,))
```
**User Value**: "When was my water last checked?"

### 2. System Report Card
```python
def calculate_grade(system_data):
    # A: No violations
    # B: Minor violations, no health
    # C: Some health violations
    # D: Many violations
    # F: Critical health violations
```
**User Value**: Simple A-F grade anyone understands

### 3. Violation Trends
```python
# Show if getting better or worse
violations_by_year = db.query_df("""
    SELECT 
        strftime('%Y', NON_COMPL_PER_BEGIN_DATE) as year,
        COUNT(*) as violations
    FROM violations_enforcement
    WHERE PWSID = ?
    GROUP BY year
""")
```
**User Value**: "Is my water getting safer?"

### 4. Boil Water Advisories
```python
# From pn_violation_assoc table
active_notices = db.query_df("""
    SELECT * FROM pn_violation_assoc
    WHERE PWSID = ? 
    AND PN_TYPE_CODE IN ('BWN', 'TIER1')
""")
```
**User Value**: Critical safety alerts

### 5. Treatment Methods (facilities table - not imported yet)
```python
# What treatment does my water get?
facilities = pd.read_csv('data/SDWA_FACILITIES.csv')
# Show: Chlorination, Filtration, UV, etc.
```
**User Value**: "How is my water treated?"

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priority

1. **Day 1**: Add last inspection date to system search
2. **Day 2**: Create A-F report cards  
3. **Day 3**: Add violation trending chart
4. **Day 4**: Import facilities, show treatment
5. **Day 5**: Add email alerts for new violations

## ðŸ’¡ Why These Matter

Current app shows **what's wrong NOW**.
These features would show:
- **History**: How we got here
- **Trends**: Where we're heading  
- **Actions**: What's being done
- **Prevention**: How water is protected

This transforms the app from a "violation viewer" to a "water quality guardian".
